		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>Inside the Catacombs of San Sebastiano, four levels have been excavated. Near the catacombs, the Appian Way passes through a valley. On its slopes houses and columbarii were built. In the valley bottom (called &quot;ad catacumbas&quot; now synonymous with underground cemetery) were erected three mausoleums which probably marked the beginning of the cemetery. When the Church became the owner of the site in the 3rd century the mausoleums were covered by a platform arranged as a covered courtyard called a <em>triclia</em>. In the 4th century a basilica with a nave and two aisles was built above the earlier structures and surrounded by mausoleums. It was here, near where the Apostles Peter and Paul were venerated, that St Sebastian was buried. He was a soldier martyred during the persecution in Diocletian&rsquo;s reign (284-305). When he was finally discovered to be a Christian, in 286, he was handed over to the Mauretanian archers, who pierced him with arrows;&nbsp; he was finally killed by the blows of a club and his body was thrown into the Cloaca Maxima. He miraculously appeared&nbsp;to the matron Irene who collected his body and carried to the catacombs that bear his name. His cult became so popular that in the 5th century a crypt was excavated around his tomb. The basilica was altered in the 13th century then rebuilt in the 17th century for Cardinal Scipio Borghese. The new church was built above the nave of the previous building. </div><div>The tour of this catacomb, which has second-century pagan tombs along with Christian chapels, will take you down a staircase studded with pieces of sarcophagi with imperial seals. Underneath the church, you&rsquo;ll see an area with three decorated pagan tombs with some very attractive frescoes and a floor mosaic. It is believed that both Christian and pagan funerals were held in the elaborate central chapel, the vault of which has acanthus and lotus-leaf stucco decorations. The Chapel of Symbols has early Christian symbols carved in it. Up another staircase is a dining room for funeral banquets. The graffiti date back to the second century.</div><div><strong>Connections</strong>: Bus 118 - 218 - 660</div>]]></descrizione>

Under the basilica and in the area around it, are the galleries of a vast catacomb, discovered by chance in 1865 and certainly previous to the burial of the Saint, as proven by numerous inscriptions found here. The three-storey&nbsp;cemetery, without frescoes, si divided into four areas. The oldest one is on the left hand side of the basilica and has a niche closed by a huge slab, as in jewish tombs.

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>This extensive network of galleries began in the private cemetery of Domitilla, whose uncle, the emperor Domitian (81-96), belonged to the rich Flavian family. In 95 Domitilla&rsquo;s husband, Flavius Clemens was denounced as a Christian and executed on Domitian&rsquo;s orders. Domitilla was exiled to the Isle of Pandataria (now called Ventotene).<br />Domitilla&rsquo;s catacombs became famous in the fourth century when a basilica was built over the graves of St Nereus and St Achilleus. According to legend they were two of Domitilla&rsquo;s servants who like their mistress converted to Christianity. In fact they were two soldiers maryred under Diocletian (284-305). Not far from their tomb lay St Petronilla whose sarcophagus was transferred to the Vatican in the eight century.&nbsp;The church built over the grave of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus is a three-naved basilica. Amongst the numerous objects found in the ruins were two pillars which had supported the giborium ornamented with sculptures representing the death of the two saints by decapitation; one of these pillars is perfectly preserved, and the name of Achilleus is carved on it. Behind the apse is a fresco representing Santa Petronilla and Santa Veneranda. On the right of the basilica is one of the oldest parts of the cemetery (2nd century), where members of the Flavian family were buried. Linked to it is a cubiculum with a fresco of Christ the&nbsp;Good Shepherd. Another area, known as &quot;della Madonna&quot; (of the Virgin), has different paintings dating back to the third and fourth century, among those is the Magi approaching the Virgin with child. </div><div><strong>Connections</strong>: Bus 714</div>]]></descrizione>

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>The catacomb of Priscilla&nbsp;is the oldest general cemetery of Early Christian Rome&nbsp;and the best preserved. It is located along the via Salaria. The first nucleus of the catacomb - among the largest in&nbsp;Rome - dates back to the second&nbsp;century, as proven by several inscriptions with the names of&nbsp;Peter and Paul. It takes its name from Priscilla, the mother of the Senator Pudens in whose house St. Peter, according to ancient tradition, found refuge.&nbsp;Not far from the modern entrance to the cemetery is the elegant subterranean chapel or crypt known as the Capella Greca, from two Greek epitaphs found there; this crypt is ornamented with very ancient symbolic frescoes, the most important of which is the celebrated Eucharistic painting in the apse, known as the Fractio Panis, because in it a figure (the priest) is breaking bread and giving it to persons seated at the same table. There is also here a very ancient fresco of the Blessed Virgin holding to her breast the Infant Jesus. In the fourth century a basilica was raised on this site - known as S Silvestro - now mostly rebuilt.</div><div><strong>Connections</strong>: Bus 63 - 86 - 92 - 310 - 630</div><div><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible for groups to celebrate mass in the catacomb with their own officiant, by telephone booking a few days before.Guided visits in Italian, English, French, German and Spanish for small groups with no booking required.

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>The Catacombs of San Callisto are the best known of the Roman catacombs and the first official underground burial site for early Christians, including many second- and third-century martyrs. It was probably Calixtus who was chiefly responsible for the Church becoming the legal owner of the cemeteries. Calixtus was appointed administrator of the cemetery which bears his name by pope Zephyrinus. In 217 he succeeded Zephyrinus as pope and five years later he died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Excavations have revealed five different levels of loculi, niches where the bodies, wrapped in sheets, were placed in tiers. The openings to the loculi were closed with slabs of marble, but these have long since disappeared, as have any artifacts of value. A major attraction is the papal crypt with the remains of several martyred early popes. Nearby, with its Byzantine frescoes, is the Cubiculum of St. Cecilia, whose body was discovered here by Pope Paschal I and moved to Santa Cecilia in Trastever. Other cubicles have frescoes and Christian symbols carved on the walls. In the crypt of St. Eusebius is a sarcophagus containing two mummified bodies.</div><div><strong>Connections</strong>: Bus 118 -218</div>]]></descrizione>

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The complex, described in the sources as &ldquo;inter duas lauros&rdquo; from the ancient name of the place, includes the Catacomb of Marcellinus and Peter, the basilica of the same name and the Mausoleum of Helena, also known as Tor Pignattara. The access to the catacombs is from the courtyard of the basilica. The tombs of the two saints (with whom pilgrims were wont to worship Tiburtius, Gorgonius, the Four Crowned Martyrs and two groups of anonymous martyrs, all victims of Diocletian persecution) were at first two simple burial niches, then enriched by monumental marble decorations as wished by Pope Damasus (366-84), who seemed to have known the vicissitudes of Marcellinus and Peter from their own torturer. Damasus made the access stairs and an obligatory path for pilgrims, which wound above and underground. The bodies of the two martyrs remained in the underground crypt until the papacy of Gregory IV (826), when they were brought to France and then to Germany. The great worship of the faithful is proved by numerous graffiti in the little apse and in the galleries that lead towards the tombs of the martyrs. Not only there are invocations in Latin, but also in Runic as a proof of the fact that the place for worship was attended by the Celts and the Germans. The catacombs, decorated by biblical scenes, are among the biggest of those present in Rome. Honorius I (625-38) built a little underground basilica with an apse to receive the more and more numerous faithful, he doubled the access stairs to the basilica and consecrated an altar above the two niches. The new sanctuary dedicated to the Four Crowned was created between the V and VII centuries and connected to the first martyrial core with one-way paths marked with skylights. Moreover, to help the walk of the crowd of pilgrims, the secondary galleries and niches were blocked and new staircases were built. Eventually, Adrian I (last quarter of the VIII century) did the last extension of the building. Among the paintings is worth seeing the Epiphany and the two Magi.</span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size="3"></font></span><strong>Connections</strong>: Bus 105 - 157 - 555 Ferrovie Laziali Termini-Pantano</div>]]></descrizione>

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>These catacombs were discovered in 1859 and are one of the best examples of burial structures of Rome&rsquo;s Jewish community, already present in this city as far back as the 2nd century BC and that became increasingly more numerous especially during the Empire. Access to the catacombs is through a huge rectangular hall, originally open-air and later divided into two and covered by a vault, probably in order to be used as a synagogue. The tunnels have &ldquo;shaped&rdquo; tombs, that is, excavated in the floor, as well as brick-sealed loculi, arcosolia and the characteristic K&ocirc;chim tombs, of Phoenician origin, consisting of oven-type loculi on several levels. Some painted cubicles depict not only flower motifs and animals but also subjects typical of the Jewish faith such as the Ark of the Covenant and the seven-branch candelabrum. There are curiouslyno Hebrew inscriptions. The catacombs reached their maximum development in the 3rd and 4th century AD.</div><div>Reservation: by e-mail to laeti@tiscalinet.it for groups min 12 max 16 persons.</div>]]></descrizione>

		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>The catacombs perhaps take their name from the local landowner of the time and were known as far back as the 16th century, although excavated between 1847 and 1872. In 1931 a vast burial ground was also discovered above ground, featuring the presence of tombs of people of senatorial rank and of members of the imperial family. This area had previously been occupied by the huge residence of Herod Atticus (the so-called Triopius) and on his death became imperial property and occupied by high level tombs. Amongst other things, the sarcophagus of Emperor Balbinus (238 AD) was found here and is evidence of the elitist nature of the burial site. One part of the catacombs also reuses a long tunnel, probably an abandoned cistern, called the Spelunca Magna. The catacombs date back to the early 3rd century AD and consisted of three main complexes on various levels. In the 4th century these three complexes were enlarged by creating a vast network of tunnels and cubicles. In the same period, places of worship were also built in the areaabove ground along with the burials, such as the basilica of Zeno and Tiburtius, and the basilica of Valerian and Maximus, of which there is no longer trace. The paintings in the cubicles are very interesting, particularly a scene dating back to the 3rd century, depicting the crowning of Christ, considered one of the oldest examples of representation of the Passion. Other frescoes, of the 4th century, depict the apostles Peter and Paul, and popes Sixtus II and Liberius. </div>]]></descrizione>

		</link>
		<descrizione><![CDATA[<div>The catacomb is situated along the Via Flaminia, near a large burial ground featuring some mausoleums leaning up against the Parioli hill and which date back to between the 1st and 2nd century AD. The catacomb was discovered by Bosio, who owned a villaright above it in the 17th century. The first phase of the catacomb dates back to the 3rd century: a level entranceway led on to a series of orthogonal passageways excavated following a grid system. During the 4th century, probably on the site of Saint Valentine&rsquo;s tomb, a three-nave basilica was built with a crypt and an apse excavated in the Parioli hill. This period also saw the excavation of two new levels of passageways above the original level. The basilica underwent changes in the mid 7th century. Some tombs dating back to between the 4th and 6th century have been found inside. The cult of the martyr Saint Valentine seems to date back to Constantine&rsquo;s times, although there are two martyrs of the same name associated with the Via Flaminia, in Rome and in Terni. It is likely that it is the same martyr who was born in Terni and also venerated in Rome. </div>]]></descrizione>
